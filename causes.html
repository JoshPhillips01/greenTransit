                  <h1>Causes:</h1>
                  <h2>Green House Gases And Vehicle Emissions:</h2>

                    <section class="causesLeftCol">

                      <h4>What are greenhouse gases?</h4>

                        <p>
                            Solar energy absorbed at Earth's surface is radiated back into the atmosphere as heat. As the heat makes its way through the atmosphere and back out to space, the greenhouse gases absorb a lot of it. Acting like a thermal blanket this keeps the heat trapped within the atmosphere which causes the earth to continually warm up.
                        </p>

                      <h4>Idle cars.</h4>

                        <p>
                          An operating vehicle emits a range of gases from its tailpipe into the atmosphere, one of which is carbon dioxide CO2 – the principal greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Idling for over 10 seconds uses more fuel and produces more CO2 compared to restarting your engine. If you're going to be stopped for more than 60 seconds – except in traffic – turn the engine off. Unnecessary idling wastes money and fuel, and produces greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          An idling car uses between 1/5 to 7/10 of a gallon of fuel an hour. An idling diesel truck burns approximately one gallon of fuel an hour.
                          <Br>
                          <Br>
                          The health experts say children and older people are most at risk from toxic air and so “no idling” zones should be used outside schools, care homes and hospitals.
                        </p>


                        <h4>Burning Fossil Fuels.</h4>

                          <p>
                            The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for energy is the main contributor to the rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide that is driving climate change.  Fossil fuel extraction, processing and burning also has other negative health effects on communities.  For example, air pollution kills around 7 million people a year.
                          </p>

                      <h4>Too Many Cars.</h4>

                        <p>
                          Cars consume a lot of energy before they ever make it to the open road. Automotive production leaves a giant footprint because materials like steel, rubber, glass, plastics, paints, and many more must be created before a new ride is ready to roll.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                          A regular rush-hour driver wastes an average of 99 gallons of gasoline a year due to traffic. The average cost of the time lost in rush hour traffic is $1,160 per person.
                          Rush hour congestion had the highest emission and fuel consumption rates

                      <h4>Health Issues</h4>

                        <p>
                          Climate change is expected to worsen regional ground-level ozone pollution. Exposure to ground level ozone has been linked to respiratory health problems ranging from decreased lung function and aggravated asthma to increased emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and even premature death.
                        </p>

                      <h4>Climate Change</h4>

                        <p>
                          A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the oceans and partially melt glaciers and other ice, increasing sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rise.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.
                          Some crops and other plants may respond favorably to increased atmospheric CO2, growing more vigorously and using water more efficiently. At the same time, higher temperatures and shifting climate patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and affect the makeup of natural plant communities.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          With rising sea levels, salt water can seep into into groundwater tables and taint the drinking water supply, and can also displace populations from low-lying areas. And displaced populations have notoriously poor health statistics.

                        Smog hanging over cities is the most familiar and obvious form of air pollution. But there are different kinds of pollution—some visible, some invisible—that contribute to global warming.
