                      <h4>Public Transport.</h4>

                        <p>
                          Public transportation is the single greatest way to reduce oneâ€™s personal carbon footprint
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          By using the train or public bus you can make a difference.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          For every passenger-mile traveled, public transportation is twice as fuel-efficient as private automobiles, sport utility vehicles and light trucks.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Most rail transit vehicles emit little or no pollution, as they are powered by electricity. Other transit vehicles, such as buses, use alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas or fuel cells which produce fewer pollutants.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Light rail systems produce 62% less and bus transit produces 33% less greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile than an average single-occupancy vehicle.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Public transportation helps increase the productivity of labor by reducing travel time and out-of-the-pocket costs of commuters in congested areas.

                          <br>
                          Diesel and gas accounted for nearly 90% of all fuel consumed by buses in 2000, but by 2009 this number had dropped to 75%.
                          Transit agencies have been very active in the last several years purchasing vehicles propelled by alternative fuels.

                        <h4>Cut Down On Idleing.</h4>

                          <p>
                          Make the air healthier by cutting down on hazardous pollution in your town or community. Idling tailpipes spew out the same pollutants as moving cars. These pollutants have been linked to serious human illnesses including asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and cancer.

                          <p>
                            Biking and walking are two amazing ways you can get to different locations. Both of these activities are cheaper, more pleasant than sitting in a car for hours everyday. And it will improve your physical and mental health at the same time too.
